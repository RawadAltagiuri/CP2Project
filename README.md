# JSON Parser for US States Database

A JSON parser in C++ for a JSON database containing information about the states in the USA.

## Description

In the text file `us_states.xml` you will find the complete list of all the states in the United States of America. For each state, you have the following information:
- Name of the state
- Abbreviation
- Capital
- Date of admission to the union
- Most populous city
- Population
- Area in square miles
- One or two time zones, depending on how big the state is
- Whether or not the state follows daylight saving time

## Implementation

Implement a library to access and interrogate the file. You must:
1. Read the file and store all the data in a table (therefore, create a class to store the data with attributes and methods).
2. Implement functions to query the database from the objects you have in memory.
